Recent advances in technology have allowed new car models to be designed with built-in AI features. The goal of the project is to develop a mobile application for use with older vehicles that integrate some of these features. When set up, it will act as a passive tool that helps users drive safely by notifying them of certain conditions in real time.
The result of the project will be an Android app that uses image processing and text recognition for lane detection and speed signs to understand what it takes to warn users. It will use the mobile device as the sole medium for data retrieval and processing to take place. There is no connection to any external devices such as servers which means that latency in the application will be minimal.
